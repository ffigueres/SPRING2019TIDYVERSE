Data Import with Readr

Readr's primary function is to load plain-text rectangular files into R data frames. It's also able to write data frames to different flat files and it includes additional functions to address different data types, unconventional delimiters, encoding, etc.

In this vignette, we will explain how to install and load the package and then explore its basic functionality by loading a CSV file into R. Finally, we will save our data frame as a TSV file.
